              Hi! I am Goku!
              I am a Saiya-jin. It is a warrior's race from another planet. Yes. I'm not an earthling. I have been sent to Earth with
              the goal of dominating and selling this planet after this. But the story didn't happen this way. When my ship arrived on
              the Earth, a good man found me and cares for me. The saiya-jins are very aggressive since babies and I was not
              different. Sometimes I have punched, bitten, and kicked my grandpa. One day I was in the back of my grandpa on the top
              of a mountain and I have fallen and hit my head strongly. Since this day I have become a good boy. I have grown strong
              and smart. Nowadays I am the most powerful warrior in the universe. I reached a high level and faced a lot of opponents
              and challenges. But today I'm just a picture of a tutorial for new web developers. It is like the people speak: Days of
              fights and days of glory. In my case, the glory is already gone.
